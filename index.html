<h2>Explore North America's Largest Sand Dunes</h2>
        
        <p>Twenty thousand years ago, 97% of Canada was covered by a thick sheet of ice. As the glaciers retreated, they left behind spectacular natural phenomena, including the Bay of Fundy, Newfoundland's Gros Morne and an area in norther Saskatchewan that looks very much as if the Sahara has relocated to the boreal forests of Canada. The Athabasca Sand Dunes blanket one hundred square kilometres on the southern edge of Lake Athabasca. They are the result of glaciers depositing bedrock into a delta, receding and exposing the remains of thousands of years of erosive wind. Local Dene nations, on the other hand, believe the dunes were created by a giant beaver, which does seem more patriotic.This is not a desert. The dune looks over a huge freshwater lake, which is fed by streams, steady rains and winter snowmelt. <br>Yet the size of Athabasca makes it <em>look</em> like a desert and not a freak of nature. The area is ecologically unusual and extremely fragile, containing three hundred plant species, including ten endangered plants you simply won't find anywhere else in the world. Hard-core wilderness lovers can fly in and camp in six designated camping areas, packing everything in and out so as not to disturb the natural environment in any way. As someone who's hiked in sand dunes before, I can assure you the fun wears off just as quickly as your shoes fill with sand. Still, theres something to be said for climbing a tall, kilometre-long sand dune, and theres something even more wonderful about doing such a thing in Canada.</p>

        <h3><strong>Kissing A Cod in Newfoundland</strong></h3>
    <p class="dropcap"> <strong>Big Jibs.</strong> Newcomers can be forgiven for feeling a bit intimidated when setting foot in Newfoundland for the first time. For starters, the regional dialect may be recognizable as English, but it can be all but indecipherable to a first-time "Come-From-Away", especially when the more mischievous locals (whom you should never, ever call "Newfies") crank up their quirkiness just for sport. If you really want to ingratiate yourself with locals, you're likely to find yourself face-to-face with a fish. "Kissing the Cod" is part of an elaborate welcoming ceremony called the "screech-in", which usually takes place in a pub like the ones that line George Street in the provincial capital, St.Joh's. The ritual begins with a friendly bartender presenting newcomers with a shot of Screech, a locally produced Jamaican-style rum, amd asking, "Are ye a screecher?" The correct response is, <em>"Deed I is, me ol' clock! And long may yer big jib draw!"</em> This translates as, <strong>"Yes I am, my old friend, and may your sails always catch wind."</strong> After downing the Screech, it's time to pucker up. Once the cod has been kissed, newcomers are pronounced Honorary Newfoundlanders and presented with a certificate from the Royal Order of Newfoundland Screechers.</p>

        <h2>Have a Happy Folk Festival</h2>
        
        <p> The Winnipeg Fold Festival is one of the world's most popular music festivals, a bold statement backed up by its enduring legacy, its global reputation and the participatory nature of the community to which it belongs. Of the roughly 16,000 people who visit each day, 6,000 will be camping onsite on grounds that have turned into a destination unto themselves. Festival animation areas allow amateur musicians to perform, while others can rest in hammocks, drum in tipis, play giant board games, dress up and join jolly daily parades. As much fun as the camping is (the limited spaces sell out quickly), performances by some of the best musicians on the planet are still the primary draw. Canadian summers are a time for outdoor celebration. The folk festivals of Edmonton, Vancouver, Yellowknife, and Regina do an incredible job allowing people of all ages and musical tastes to come together, listen, party, interact, and get involved. Winnipeg, that beating heart of culture in the middle of Canada, hosts the granddaddy of them all.</p>
